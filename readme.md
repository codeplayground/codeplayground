## Why it's awesome

We're so happy you're here. We founded Codeplayground because we wanted to create a trustworthy and inspiring place for you to find everything you need to create and store code snippet in a secure and confortable way.

We hope you'll get lost in our boards with awesome codes and super profiles, and we'd like to thank you for signing up offering our full attention. This means a lot to us ♥.
